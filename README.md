#### COVID-19 Data Mining Project 

## Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. First identified back in December 2019 in Wuhan province, China, the COVID-19 virus has resulted in nearly 9 million confirmed cases globally [2]. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, global social media usage on platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and etc. has surged significantly [3]. As the general population depend heavily on various social media platforms to gather the latest information about the pandemic and as well as to voice their opinions, an increase of daily users and daily activities was observed.

An interesting data mining topic to focus on for the COVID-19 pandemic is determining a correlation between the spread of awareness and other COVID-19 related sentiments on the Twitter social media platform, with the number of reported confirmed cases for a given country over a period of time. As the pandemic originated from China in Asia, and only after a three-month period before the virus quickly spread across North America; it would be very interesting to follow the influx of COVID-19 related tweets as the pandemic reaches a certain country and begin to spread rapidly.

Using various data mining techniques, the relationship of two particular COVID-19 related data sets can be extracted, processed, and analyzed. The first data set is the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [2]. The second data set is the COVID -19 Twitter chatter data set gathered by Panacea Lab from the Georgia state University [4].

The relationship between social media coverage and reported confirmed COVID-19 cases over time could indicate how global level events can spread and propagate through social media platforms as the intensity or seriousness of the event accumulates.
