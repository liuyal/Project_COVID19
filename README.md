## COVID-19 Data Mining Project

## Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. First identified back in December 2019 in Wuhan province, China, the COVID-19 virus has resulted in nearly 9 million confirmed cases globally [2]. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, global social media usage on platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and etc. has surged significantly [3]. As the general population depend heavily on various social media platforms to gather the latest information about the pandemic and as well as to voice their opinions, an increase of daily users and daily activities was observed.

An interesting data mining topic to focus on for the COVID-19 pandemic is determining the relationship between the spread of awareness and COVID-19 related topics and sentiments on the social media platform Twitter, with the number of reported confirmed cases for a given country over a period of time. Since the pandemic originated from Asia, and only after a three-month period before the virus quickly spread across North America; it would be very interesting to follow the influx of COVID-19 related tweets as the pandemic reaches a country and begin to spread rapidly.

Using various data mining techniques, the relationship of two particular COVID-19 related datasets can be extracted, processed, and analyzed. The first dataset is the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [2]. This dataset contains daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from all countries and is great an aggregated data source. The second dataset is the COVID -19 Tweet ID dataset gathered by University of Southern California Ph.D. student Emily Chen [4]. The Tweet ID dataset contains all COVID-19 related tweets starting from January, and is updated frequently. Hydration methods will be performed to extract the original tweet text.

The relationship between trending social media topics and reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over a given time period could be very interesting to measure and observe; it could help indicate how global level events spread and propagate through social media platforms as the intensity or seriousness of the event accumulates.
